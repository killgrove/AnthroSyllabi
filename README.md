AnthroSyllabi
=============

Posted some syllabi for the classes I taught last AY (2012-13).  Feel free to borrow, fork, 
or use them to generate ideas for your own course!

(FAQ: No, I don't think this made students read the syllabus any more than they had read the un-spiffed-up
ones in the past.  But they did give off a good first impression to my students and colleagues!)

As with other large file types, GitHub can't display Publisher or Pages files, and you can't right-click to download the file
from the main repository page.  So just click on the Download ZIP button on the right --->

If you aren't interested in the Publisher/Pages files, you can find my course syllabi in PDF form at my Academia.edu page.

I'm posting these with a CC BY-NC-SA license (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike). I'd 
appreciate an attribution if you use/reuse these for your (non-profit) courses.
