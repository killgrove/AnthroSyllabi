AnthroSyllabi
=============

Posted some syllabi for the classes I taught last AY (2012-13).  Feel free to borrow, fork, 
or use them to generate ideas for your own course!

(FAQ: No, I don't think this made students read the syllabus any more than they had read the un-spiffed-up
ones in the past.  But they did give off a good first impression to my students and colleagues!)
